Basic Informational Site
This project, part of the NodeJS course, is designed to help you apply your knowledge of NodeJS to create a basic informational website. By now, you should have acquired enough understanding to start building something practical with NodeJS.

Project Overview:
The Basic Informational Site consists of four main pages: index, about, contact-me, and 404. The focus of this project is not on elaborate content or design, but rather on implementing the server-side logic to serve the appropriate HTML files based on the URL.

Assignment Details:
Project Directory Setup:

Create a project directory.
Inside the directory, create the following files:
index.html
about.html
contact-me.html
404.html
NodeJS Server Implementation:

Create a NodeJS server file named index.js.
Implement the server logic to serve the correct HTML page based on the URL:
Accessing localhost:8080 should display index.html.
Accessing localhost:8080/about should display about.html.
Accessing localhost:8080/contact-me should display contact-me.html.
Accessing any other URL should result in displaying 404.html.
Guidance:
Remember to utilize the knowledge gained from the previous lessons if you encounter any difficulties.
Focus on the functionality of serving the correct HTML pages rather than on elaborate page content or design.
Take advantage of NodeJS's built-in modules to handle HTTP requests and serve static HTML files effectively.
